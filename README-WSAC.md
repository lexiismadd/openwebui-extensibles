# 🌐 Web Search and Crawl for Open WebUI

**Version:** 2.8.1

**Author:** lexiismadd

This tool enables your Open WebUI instance to not only search the internet but to **deeply crawl, extract, and summarise** content from web pages. It combines the power of search engines (**SearXNG** and *Open WebUI Native Search**) with the advanced extraction capabilities of **Crawl4AI**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dual-Engine Search:** Simultaneously utilises [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) and OpenWebUI Native Search to find the most relevant URLs.
* **Intelligent Crawling:** Powered by [Crawl4AI](https://crawl4ai.com), it extracts clean, markdown-formatted content while stripping away ads, sidebars, and navigation clutter.
* **Research Mode:** Recursively follows links on discovered pages to perform "Deep Research" based on keyword relevance using **Crawl4AI**'s **Deep Crawl** feature. (*User-specific setting*)
* **LLM-Driven Extraction:** Uses an OpenAI-compatible LLM (like GPT-4, Claude, or Ollama) to summarise and structure the crawled data before it reaches your chat.
* **Media Enrichment:** Automatically identifies and displays high-quality images and videos from the sources, providing clickable thumbnails directly in the chat. (*User-specific setting*)
* **Smart Token Management:** Includes automatic content truncation and token counting (via `tiktoken`) to ensure responses stay within model limits.
* **Concurrent Validation:** Validates image URLs in batches to ensure only "live" media is displayed.
* **Highly Configurable:** Offers many configuration valves to tune the tool to your preference and environment.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Trigger:** When you ask a question requiring real-time data, the tool is called.
2. **Gathering:** It queries SearXNG or Native Search and combines those results with any specific URLs you provided.
3. **Crawling:** It sends those URLs to a self-hosted **Crawl4AI** instance.
4. **Extraction:** The LLM configured in the "Valves" processes the raw HTML/Markdown into a structured summary focusing on your core instructions.
5. **Delivery:** The tool returns a clean list of summaries, citations, and a gallery of relevant media to the chat interface.
